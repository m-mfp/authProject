## About Me

This repository showcases my skills in implementing various authentication solutions using Auth0 across multiple platforms and tech stacks:

- **Regular Web Application (Golang):** A full-featured web app demonstrating secure user authentication and session management using Auth0.
- **Single Page Application (React):** A clean and simple React app implementing user login/logout flows with Auth0, showing my frontend authentication expertise.
- **Native Application (JavaScript):** An in-progress native app project utilizing JavaScript to integrate Auth0 authentication.
- **Machine-to-Machine (Python):** An ongoing project focused on secure machine-to-machine authentication using Python and Auth0.

Each project demonstrates my ability to integrate Auth0's authentication flows in different environments, balancing security with usability.
