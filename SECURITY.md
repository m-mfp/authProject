# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We take the security of this project very seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability or issue, please do **not** open a public issue on GitHub, as it may expose the vulnerability to the public before it is resolved.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities privately by contacting us at:

- Submit a security report via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/m-mfp/authProject/security/advisories)

Please include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, impact assessment, and any relevant code or configuration.

## Response Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of the security report within 48 hours.
- We aim to investigate and address security issues promptly.
- If applicable, we will release patches or updates and notify affected users.
- We will keep reporting parties informed about the progress until the issue is resolved.

## Supported Versions

Please specify which versions of the project are affected by the reported vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices

- Do not commit any sensitive information (API keys, secrets) to the repository.
- Use environment variables to manage secrets securely.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date to avoid security risks in third-party libraries.
- Follow best practices for authentication and authorization.
